**TagIn RIFT**

NFC-Based Product Authentication & Ownership System on Algorand
TagIn RIFT is a blockchain-powered product authentication system built on the Algorand blockchain. 
It enables manufacturers to mint tamper-proof product NFTs, store metadata hashes on-chain, 
and allow consumers to verify authenticity instantly via NFC tap.

This system eliminates counterfeit products by combining:
🧾 On-chain metadata hashing
📦 NFT-based ownership tracking
📱 NFC-powered instant verification
🔄 Real time ownership transfer
🗃️ Backend logging & analytics

Problem Statement

Counterfeit goods cost global industries billions every year.
Traditional verification methods:
Can be forged,
Rely on centralized databases
Are difficult for consumers to verify,
Do not track ownership history

TagIn RIFT solves this by leveraging:
Algorand blockchain immutability + NFC real-world interaction

🏗️ System Architecture
Manufacturer → Mint NFT → Store Metadata Hash On-Chain
                     ↓
              Store Product in Database
                     ↓
        Consumer taps NFC → Opens Verify URL
                     ↓
     Frontend Recomputes Hash → Compares On-Chain
                     ↓
        If match → Product Verified
                     ↓
        Ownership transfers logged on-chain + backend

🔗 Why Algorand?
TagIn RIFT is built on Algorand Testnet because:
⚡ 4.5 second finality
💰 Extremely low transaction fees
🔐 Native metadataHash support in ASA (Algorand Standard Assets)
📦 Smart Contract box storage (for product hash storage)
🌍 Environmentally sustainable blockchain

🛠️ Core Features
1️⃣ Manufacturer Whitelisting
Whitelisted manufacturer wallets stored in smart contract box storage
Only approved wallets can mint verified products

2️⃣ NFT Minting (Algorand ASA)
Each product:
Is minted as an Algorand Standard Asset (ASA)
Has total supply = 1
metadataHash = SHA-256 of product metadata
Is owned initially by manufacturer

3️⃣ On-Chain Metadata Protection
Product metadata is:
JSON formatted
Sorted by key
SHA-256 hashed
Stored:
In ASA metadataHash field
Inside smart contract box storage (PROD_<assetId>)
This ensures:
Tamper detection
Backend integrity verification
On-chain authenticity guarantee

4️⃣ NFC Tap Verification
Each product contains an NFC tag with a URL:
https://tag-in-rift.vercel.app/v/<assetId>
When tapped:
Browser opens verify page
App fetches:
On-chain stored hash
Backend product data
Recomputes hash
Compares both
Displays result instantly
No wallet required for verification.

5️⃣ Ownership Transfer
Owners can:
Connect Algorand wallet
Transfer NFT using Algorand SDK
Automatically update backend
View complete transfer history
All transfers:
Confirmed on-chain
Logged in backend database
Displayed in UI

6️⃣ User Inventory
Users can:
Connect wallet
Fetch ASA holdings directly from Algod
Display only valid product NFTs
View transfer history
Transfer ownership

🔐 Security Design
Tamper Prevention
If backend data is altered:
Recomputed hash ≠ on-chain hash
Verification fails
If NFC URL is copied:
Ownership & metadata still validated on-chain
If NFT is transferred:
Ownership reflects real-time wallet holder
